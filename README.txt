The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side
processing. In this project, I have deployed a static website to AWS.
First, you will create a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website
hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. Next, I have uploaded the
website files to my bucket and speed up content delivery using
AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, I have
accessd my website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
